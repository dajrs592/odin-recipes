    <h1>Roasted Brussels Sprouts</h1>
    <p>This recipe is from my mother. It may sound strange, but these are really good and very easy to make. The Brussels sprouts should be brown with a bit of black on the outside when done. Any leftovers can be reheated or even just eaten cold from the fridge. I don't know how, but these Brussels sprouts taste sweet and salty at the same time!</p>
