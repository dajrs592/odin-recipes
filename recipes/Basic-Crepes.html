  <li><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
        <ul>1 cup all-purpose flour</ul>
        <ul>2 eggs</ul>
        <ul>1/2 cup milk</ul>
        <ul>1/2 cup water</ul>
        <ul>1/4 teaspoon salt</ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons butter, melted</ul>
    </li>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</p>
    <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</p>
    <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</p>
